# bike-display-from-cadence-sensor
A project to creates a bicycle odometer & speedometer display on a 2-lines LCD screen using a cadence sensor.

The goals are to make the bike display system cheaper than what's in the markets. While also teach us how to work on a project from designing, parts selection, coding and mechanics of installation. Since this is the first time working on a project of this scale for 3 of us, if time permit, will make it pedal-powered able, with nighttime safety-light.
